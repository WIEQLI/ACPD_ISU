This repository contains the MATLAB code for the problem of nondestructive testing of metal material using alternating current potential drop measurement. The estimation of the conductivity and magnetic permeability are done by solving a linearized 1D inverse problem. 
This is a joint project of John Bowler, Thanh Nguyen, and Paul Sacks from Iowa State University. 

The instruction on how to use the program is in the file "readme.docx".
